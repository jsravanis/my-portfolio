    { text: "Sravani does truly excellent work. In my group, she added major new features to our software - Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) - and she brought us miles closer to our big goal of connecting the world's major open bioinformatics data sources to IGB, so that scientists can visually compare results and data from many different studies in the same interface. For this, she leveraged her prior work building and using APIs. In addition, she upgraded our web analytics setup, allowing us to track the number of Integrated Genome Browser downloads. At the same time, she kept outstanding notes on everything she did, giving us the ability to maintain and continue her work for years to come. She also has helped a huge amount with on-boarding and training new students. And, of course, she did all of this while earning a masters degree in a demanding and competitive Computer Science program. Based on having worked with her for most of her tenure at UNC Charlotte, I feel well-qualified to say that Sravani is a brilliant developer and communicator - top 1% in engineering skill, teamwork, and leadership.",

    { text: "I've worked with Sravani for a little over a year now as her day to day supervisor. Sravani joined our lab at UNC Charlotte as a Research Assistant working on our software, the Integrated Genome Browser. Sravani is an incredibly skilled software developer and worked on several major projects within the lab. Her biggest contribution was leading the project to integrate data from the UCSC Genome Browser REST API with the Integrated Genome Browser. Her work has been presented at several conferences including Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB), Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB), and the UNC Charlotte Biological Sciences Research Symposium. I have been truly appreciative to have Sravani as part of our team. I know she has a bright future ahead of her and highly recommend her to any future employers.",
